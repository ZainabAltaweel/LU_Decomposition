# LU_Decomposition
In order to implemented block LU decomposition as sequential code, depending on the algorithm described by Kai Hwang and Yeng-Heng Cheng (Partitioned Matrix Algorithms for VLSI Arithmetic Systems). 
The user can specify matrix size and block size as well, and the result was verified.
In the GUI, two text boxes were added to enter the array and block size, a button was added to compute LU decomposition sequentially.
